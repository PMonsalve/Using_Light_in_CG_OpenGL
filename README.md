# Using_Light_in_CG_OpenGL
The project simulates a road, a person(the nanosuit), a light pole(the stone) and cars(the planets). The light points are connected to the cars and the light pole. It's possible to see the light effects on every object. I couldn't find some models and didn't use blender to make the objects, the deadline was close and I sent to my professor, so there are some different models.

There can only be 10 light points, including the light pole one, the line nยบ164 shows how many light poits there is and initially at a far away point.


The project uses the OpenGL.

Controls:

WASD - Move camera position

Mouse - Move camera view angle

Z - Spawns car on the left

X - Spawns car on the right
